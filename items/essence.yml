    The humming noise coming from this crystcyl is powerful enough to roast marshmallows.
    I'm not kidding! 
    The marshmallows glow orange and discharge static on your tongue,
    but have a delicious coffee flavor!

    Dude, I'm seriously kind of amazed at the power of duct tape. 
    There's no way that these Hacker Spirits should be able to stick together like this.
    It's mind blowing.

    Seriously. Don't eat bressence.
    It might sound like a quick way to get five meals in the time it takes to get one. 
    It's not. Just don't.
    The last guy to try it was on the toilet for - well, I'll spare you the gory details.

    This Crystal pops, buzzes, and warps the space around it.
    Soft, warm lights dance within the Crystal's facets.

    It does not, as a matter of fact, smell like teen spirit. Except for when it does. 
    The air becomes ripe around it whenever new things are being created.

- name: Bread Essence

    It may be whole wheat, but don't hold that against it. Its rich, 
    freshly-baked aroma triggers an overwhelming nostalgia and a thoughtful sense of calm.
