    At the correct angle, this box reflects lights that mesmerize those who see it.
    Though it's telling that there is treasure to be discovered, 
    the box itself seems to be a replica of an old goblin design.

- name: Spirited Buzzwing Boxlet

    The soft humming of this boxes wing is almost musical in nature,
    sounding like an ancient hymn of an old goblin tribe. 
    Maybe inside you'll find some of their legendary treasure.

- name: Doughy Buzzwing Boxlet
  description: >-
    From the corner of one's eye, it seems that the dough on this box occasionally shifts and slides,
    as if it has been granted life by powerful magicks, known only to the ancients. 
    One knows they can find valuable trinkets within this enchanted box.
