- name: Crystalline Buzzwing Boxling
  description: >-
    A flightful box of amber with a nice shine to it.
    Other than being a decent mirror, it is sure to contain something of worth.

- name: Spirited Buzzwing Boxling
  description: >-
    Infused with the might of duct tape,
    this box flies strong, wings flapping rhythmically.
    The box itself is worth trying to open for the hope of good loot.

- name: Doughy Buzzwing Boxling
  description: >-
    For something made of dough,
    this box holds itself together well, while still being a bit malleable.
    Treasure is certain to be found within.
