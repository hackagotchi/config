  description: >-
    Once your run-of-the-mill stick,

    the energy giving Coffea Cyl plants a 10% boost to yield speed.

      buff: { YieldSpeedMultiplier: 1.10 }

- name: Vine Keyboard
  description: >-
    The loud clacking of this keyboard's keys enchant Hacker Vibes Vines, 
    sending those who hear it into a trancelike state where they work
    on their yields at a 10% faster rate.
  passive_plant_effects:
    - description: >-
        What with the pen being mightier than the sword,
        arming yourself with a nice Keyboard is never a bad idea.

      buff: { YieldSpeedMultiplier: 1.10 }

- name: Rolling Pin
  description: >-
    Bracti fear the Rolling Pin more than almost any other tool,
    and in the hands of the correct wielder, 
    it will inspire them to work harder with a 10% boost to the speed of yields.
  passive_plant_effects:
    - description: >-
        It may be better to be loved than feared,
        but the unease Rolling Pins generate among the Bractus
        crowds increase their yield speeds by 10%!
      for_plants: { Only: [ Bractus ] }
      buff: { YieldSpeedMultiplier: 1.10 }
