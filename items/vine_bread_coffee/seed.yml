- name: Coffea Cyl Seed
  description: >-
    The seed of a special species of coffee,
    descended from Coffea arabica and a host of related species. 
    Rather than beans, this plant is known to grow clusters of Crystals which grow on its limbs, 
    inside of which mystical forces coalesce.

- name: Bractus Seed
  description: >-
    Doughy, yet still somehow prickly.
    It smells slightly of yeast,
    and promises to grow into something in between a fresh loaf of sourdough
    and a certain Sonoran cactus.
