        While a young Bractus often grows in a dry area, powerful and mature Bracti often are the reason for the surroundings being so devoid of water, as they typically drain copious amounts of liquid to secrete their buttery, 
        golden sap. Using this natural tendency to drain liquids on a certain potion refines it to the point that it can transform other plants into Bracti.
